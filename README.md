# Financial-Modeling
This is a monte carlo simulation implemented in Python 3. 
The model currently takes in expected return and volatility for parameters and forecasts the expected ending value of a given financial asset.
The goal is to eventually be able to forecast option pricing using Black-Scholes to identify statistical arbitrage opportunities.
